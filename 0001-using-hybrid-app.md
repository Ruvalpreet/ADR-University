# 1. Using the hybrid app

Date: 2024-02-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

According to the request of the stakeholders, they want widespread adoption and accessibility, they want the app to be supported by both iOS and Android platforms. The app should be designed and developed with accessibility features in mind for example: text-to-speech, high contrast modes, and support for assistive technologies.

## Decision

Hybrid app will allow the app to run on multiple platforms and with the ability to interact with the device's internal API, the app can access to device's microphone and speakers.

## Consequences

1.  Hybrid app developers are much cheaper than native app developers.
2.  A single code base is being used for multiple platforms allowing it to run on multiple different devices.
3.  Hybrid apps, similar to the native apps can have access to the device-built APIs. which can allow us to implement features like text-to-speech and push notifications.
4.  The developing phase of the hybrid app is much faster than the native apps.
5.  Hybrid apps tend to be slower than native apps.
